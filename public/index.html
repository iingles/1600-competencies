                    computer language that uses &quot;tags&quot; to define elements within a document.</p>

            <p> 
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) can be described as providing &quot;structure&quot; for the document; it is the basic foundation on
                which all other parts of a website are built.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is implemented by placing various tags throughout a document that have both a functional and semantic purpose.  "Block-level" 
                elements, for example, by default take up the entire space of their parent container, and kick other elements "down" a row; whereas "inline"
                elements only take up as much space as is bounded by the beginning and end tags of the element.
            </p>
            <p>
                Semantic elements can include those such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>; other than being block level, these two
                elements have no additional impact on the behavior of the HTML on the page; and are rather used to give the browser, the user, the developer, and search engines
                a better idea of what is on the page and what the purpose of the element is. 
            </p>
            <p>
                One interesting thing that a person learning HTML and CSS should know is that the
                (<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) tag in HTML is actually a &quot;replaced element&quot; &mdash; this means
                that it is rendered outside of the scope of CSS. Put in simpler terms, replaced elements are elements
                whose contents are not affected by the current document's styles. The position of
                the replaced element can be affected using CSS, but not the contents of the replaced element itself.
                (See MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element">Replaced Element</a> page).

                <p>CSS is a declarative style-sheet language that determines the how a webpage "looks" in the browser.</p>
            </header>
            <h3>CSS Example:</h3>
            <pre class="code-block"><code class="language-css">.selector {

            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the primary (and preferred) way by which the appearance of a webpage's markup is displayed in the browser.  CSS can be used to improve the readability as well as overall aesthetic appearance of a website.  It is implemented through a huge variety of "selectors", which can be the HTML element itself, a class name, an ID name, and various pseudo-classes.  </p>
